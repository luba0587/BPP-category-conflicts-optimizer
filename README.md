BPP with conflicts between cargo types

This program finds an optimum solution of the Bin Packing Problem with conflicts between cargo types, using Gurobi (license required!)

Instances were created based on Delorme et al. (2016):
we adopted 6 cargo types and 1 compatiblity matrix (1 indicates items compatibility and 0 otherwise)
